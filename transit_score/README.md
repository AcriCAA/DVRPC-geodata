### Description
This two-phase project defines a method to assess the appropriateness of various modes and intensities of transit service throughout the DVRPC region. Phase I consisted of a statistical evaluation and refinement of New Jersey Transit's existing transit score method. This included a regression analysis to test the relationships between existing variables, additional variables, and transit mode share for the region, the State of New Jersey, and the combined area of the two. Based on the results of this evaluation, a refined transit score equation was derived for congruent use in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 

This DVRPC Transit Score Tool is as follows (all densities gross):

Transit score = [0.41*(Population per acre)] +

[0.09*(Jobs per acre)] +

[0.74*(Zero car households per acre)]


The DVRPC Transit Score Tool was then classified into five score category ranges (from low to high):

Low: < 0.6

Marginal: 0.6 to 1.0

Medium: 1.01 to 2.5

Medium-High: 2.51 to 7.5

High: > 7.5


The TAZ boundaries used in this file are the TAZ boundaries submitted to the Census Bureau in 2012.  At the time of this release, the official TIGER TAZ boundaries have not been released by the Census Bureau.
