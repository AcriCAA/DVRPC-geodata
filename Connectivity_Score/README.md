# DVRPC Connectivity Score by TAZ (2010)

### Summary
To be used for planning purposes.

### Description
The degree of interconnectivity of the street network is a great predictor of walkability and bikeability. Places with more interconnected street networks (e.g., closer to a grid) have more paths between places, making it less likely that someone on foot or on a bike would need to go far out of their way to make a trip. DVRPC’s “Connectivity Score” reflects the density of intersections across the region at the Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) level, with is an indicator of connectivity.

Dataset was originally created for DVRPC's CI2 project (http://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/CI2/). It reflects the connectivity of a place’s street network; commonly used as a proxy for walkability.
