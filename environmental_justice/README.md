# DVRPC Environmental Justice (2010)

### Summary
DVRPC identifies eight demographic groups to make up the Degree of Disadvantage (DOD) analysis:

- Non-Hispanic Minority
- Carless Households
- Households in Poverty
- Persons with a Physical Disability
- Female Head of Household with Child
- Elderly (over 75 years)
- Hispanic
- Limited English Proficiency

Census tracts that have higher concentrations of a particular demographic group than the regional average for that population are considered to be at a disadvantage. The total number of demographic groups that are above the regional average concentration in each census tract is that tract's DOD. For example, if a tract has higher than average populations for three of the identified demographic groups, then it has three DODs.

### Description
2010 Tract-level census data compiled for Environmental Justice reports. In 2001, DVRPC published "...and Justice for All" - DVRPC's Strategy for Fair Treatment and Meaningful Involvement of All People (Publication No. 01022) to identify impacts of disparate funding and services on defined low-income and minority groups. 

A methodology was created, refined in subsequent years, to identify populations that may be adversely affected by transportation planning decisions.
