# DVRPC Environmental Justice (2012)

### Summary
2012 Tract-level Indicators of Potential Disadvantage for the DVRPC Region, compiled for the Enviornmental Justice reports.

DVRPC identifies eight demographic groups to make up the Indicators of Potential Disadvantage (IPD) analysis for 2012:
- Non-Hispanic Minority
- Carless Households
- Households in Poverty
- Female Head of Household with Child
- Elderly (over 75 years)
- Hispanic
- Limited English Proficiency
- Person with a Physical Disability

Census tracts that have higher concentrations of a particular demographic group than the regional average for that population are considered to be at a disadvantage. The total number of demographic groups that are above the regional average concentration in each census tract is that tract's IPD. For example, if a tract has higher than average populations for three of the identified demographic groups, then it has 3 IPDs.

### Description
In 2001, DVRPC published "...and Justice for All" - DVRPC's Strategy for Fair Treatment and Meaningful Involvement of All People (Publication No. 01022) to identify impacts of disparate funding and services on defined low-income and minority groups. 

A methodology was created, refined in subsequent years, to identify populations that may be adversely affected by transportation planning decisions. 

Using U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) 2008-2012 five-year estimates data, the population groups listed above are identified and located at the census tract level. Data is gathered at the regional level, combining populations from each of the nine counties, for either individuals or households, depending on the indicator. From there, the total number of persons in each demographic group is divided by the appropriate universe (either population or households) for the nine-county region, providing a regional average for that population group. Any census tract that meets or exceeds the regional average level, or threshold, is considered an EJ-sensitive tract for that group.
