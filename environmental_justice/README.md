### Description
2010 Tract-level census data compiled for Environmental Justice reports. In 2001, DVRPC published "...and Justice for All" - DVRPC's Strategy for Fair Treatment and Meaningful Involvement of All People (Publication No. 01022) to identify impacts of disparate funding and services on defined low-income and minority groups. 

A methodology was created, refined in subsequent years, to identify populations that may be adversely affected by transportation planning decisions.
