# RideScore

### Summary
 RideScore is a dataset that assesses the physical and demographic characteristics around transit stations that relate to how supportive of bicycling the area is, or could be. The dataset focuses on commuter rail stations outside of Center City Philadelphia as well as trolley and subway terminals where having direct, safe, and nonmotorized access between transit stations and a person's origin and/or destination is a challenge.

### Data Development

To be used for planning purposes

### Key Attribute Fields
`STATION` Rail Station Name

`ZONE` SEPTA zone

`LINE` Rail Line

`Stations located near a walkable retail district`

*This measure evaluates a transit station’s proximity to a concentration of retail uses that have safe pedestrian facilities.*

`WLKTEXT` Stations located near a walkable, retail district scoring criteria

`WLKSCORE` Stations located near a walkable, retail district score

`WLKLABEL` Stations located near a walkable, retail district  label

`Transit Vehicle Volumes`

*Transit Vehicle Volumes are the number of buses and individual trains that serve the area at or around each station per day. The larger the volume of transit vehicles, the more connected a place is, as it's the concentrations of transit vehicles - both rail and bus - that create options for commuters to access destinations via public transit.*

`TVVTOTAL` Transit Vehicle Volumes total

`TVVSCORE` Transit Vehicle Volumes score

`TVVLABEL` Transit Vehicle Volumes label

`Stations On or Near On-Road Bicycle Facilities`

*Transit stations have been evaluated for their proximity to on-road bicycle facilities, facilities where cyclists and vehicles share the right-of-way with no physical barriers between them.  Stations have been rated based on being located on, or within 1/4-mile of an on-road facility.*

`OBFTEXT` Stations On or Near On-Road Bicycle Facilities scoring criteria

`OBFSCORE` Stations On or Near On-Road Bicycle Facilities score

`OBFLABEL` Stations On or Near On-Road Bicycle Facilities label

`Connectivity Score`

*A Connectivity Score is a rating of the connectivity of a place's street network that can be used to determine a community’s walkability. Connectivity scores for stations are based on the intersection density within 1/2-mile of the station.*

`CONTOTAL` Connectivity Score total

`CONDENSITY` Connectivity Score  raw density

`CONSCORE` Connectivity Score score

`CONLABEL` Connectivity Score label

`CONTEXT` Connectivity Score scoring criteria

`Station Proximity to the Circuit Trail Network`

*This station characteristic assesses how close a transit station is to the Delaware Valley's existing and planned network of 750 miles of walking and biking trails aimed at connecting the region to communities, jobs, and parks.* 

'CTNTEXT` Station Proximity to the Circuit Trail Network scoring criteria

`CTNSCORE` Station Proximity to the Circuit Trail Network score

`CTNLABEL` Station Proximity to the Circuit Trail Network label

`Civic and Cultural Attractors`

This station characteristic aggregates the number of civic and cultural resources within 1/2 mile of the station.

`CCTOTAL` Civic and Cultural Attractors total

`CCSCORE` Civic and Cultural Attractors score

`CCLABEL` Civic and Cultural Attractors label

`Outdoor Bicycle Destinations`

Transit stations have been evaluated for their proximity to outdoor destinations in the Delaware Valley that may be a draw to cyclists.

`OBDTEXT` Outdoor Bicycle Destinations scoring criteria

`OBDSCORE` Outdoor Bicycle Destinations score

`OBDLABEL` Outdoor Bicycle Destinations label

`Non-Parking Passenger Boards`

Transit stations are evaluated for the number of vehicles parked at the station as a percentage of the number of passengers that board trains. This difference between passenger boards and the number of parked cars can be used as an approximation of the number of passengers who access the station via walking, bicycling or getting dropped off by someone else. 

`NPPTOTAL` Non-Parking Passenger Boards total

`NPPSCORE` Non-Parking Passenger Boards score

`NPPLABEL` Non-Parking Passenger Boards label

`Number of Employees within 1 mi of Station`

This station characteristic measures the number of known employees, as identified in National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) data, within 1-mile of the station. 

`EMPTOTAL` Number of Employees within 1 mi of Station total

`EMPSCORE` Number of Employees within 1 mi of Station  score

`EMPLABEL` Number of Employees within 1 mi of Station  label

`Population Density`

Transit stations are rated on the concentration of residents - potential transit customers and origins for transit - within 1-mile of the station.

`DENPOP` Population Density population total

`DENAREA` Population Density 1 mi buffer area 

`DENTOTAL` Population Density total

`DENSCORE` Population Density score

`DENLABEL` Population Density label

`RS_FINAL` RideScore

`SYMBOL` Symbology score

`RS_LOOKUP`  Rail Line Name

`OPERATE` Rail operator

`OP` Rail operator logo path

`MCD` Municipality Name
