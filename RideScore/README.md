# RideScore

### Summary
 RideScore is a dataset that assesses the physical and demographic characteristics around transit stations that relate to how supportive of bicycling the area is, or could be. The dataset focuses on commuter rail stations outside of Center City Philadelphia as well as trolley and subway terminals where having direct, safe, and nonmotorized access between transit stations and a person's origin and/or destination is a challenge.
